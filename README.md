## Purpose
Your Github profile is an import aspect of your public identity as a developer and a well-crafted one allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers.  

It's important to have a high quality README for your applications that includes information explaining what the project if for and how to use the app. 

Through this command-line application project creators can easily generate a README file based on user input.

## Technologies:
- Javascript
- node.js
- Inquirer

## Getting-Started: 
To run the application clone the code through Github. Once installed run `npm i` to install necessary node modules and run `npm i inquirer` to install the needed inquire dependencies, to learn more vist the [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) website. 

Once the dependecies have been installed open the command line and from the root of the project directory run `node index.js` to initialize the application. The user will be prompted with a series of questions to populate the project README.md file. After each question is answered a new README.md file should be generated in same direcotry where the application is housed.
